[6]; and PCR, sequencing, and quality filtering of reads were performed as described in Caporaso et al. [14]. Samples were not collected on days 422 through 437.  To facilitate massively parallel sequencing (1967 samples), barcodes were reused across six lanes in a single Illumina GAIIx, with 374, 372, 364, 271, 265, and 323 samples in lanes one through six, respectively (differing from Caporaso et al.

Sixteen samples were ultimately excluded from the analysis as fourteen samples were identified as potentially mislabeled (discussed below), and the barcodes for two samples were not found in the sequencing output, likely indicating a problem with amplification for those two samples.
